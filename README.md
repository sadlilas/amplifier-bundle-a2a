# amplifier-bundle-a2a

Agent-to-Agent communication for [Amplifier](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier) via Google's [A2A protocol](https://github.com/google/A2A).

Enables two Amplifier sessions running on different devices — potentially different apps (CLI, web, native) — to discover each other, exchange messages, and collaborate over a network.

## What It Does

Two people, each running their own Amplifier session, can talk to each other's agents:

```
Ben's session                              Sarah's session
    |                                           |
    |  "Ask Sarah what restaurant tonight"      |
    |  ──────────────────────────────────────>  |
    |                                           |  (Sarah sees the message
    |                                           |   on her next turn)
    |                                           |
    |                                           |  "Sushi Nozawa!"
    |  <──────────────────────────────────────  |
    |                                           |
    |  "Sarah says Sushi Nozawa"                |
```

All communication happens over HTTP using the A2A protocol. The bundle handles discovery, trust, message routing, and response delivery.

## Features

### Three Interaction Modes

| Mode | When | What Happens |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Mode C** (Autonomous) | Trusted contacts | Agent answers automatically using available tools and context |
| **Mode A** (Notify-and-wait) | Known contacts | Message queued for the user; they respond on their own time |
| **Mode B** (Live injection) | Active session | Message appears immediately in the user's current session |

Modes escalate automatically: C (can't answer?) -> A (user is active?) -> B. Users can defer Mode B messages back to Mode A with "not now."

### Discovery

- **mDNS/Zeroconf** — Agents on the same LAN find each other automatically
- **Manual URLs** — For Tailscale, VPN, or cross-network connections

### Trust & Contacts

- **Unknown agents** are blocked until the user approves them
- **Known contacts** require the user's input for every message (Mode A)
- **Trusted contacts** get autonomous responses (Mode C), escalating to the user only when the agent can't answer confidently

### Per-Contact Capability Scoping

Trusted contacts' requests are handled by sessions with full tool access. Known contacts get a restricted whitelist (read-only filesystem, search — no bash, no web). Configurable per tier.

### Response Attribution

Every response includes how it was generated:
- `"autonomous"` — Agent answered without human involvement
- `"user_response"` — Human answered directly
- `"escalated_user_response"` — Agent tried, couldn't answer, human responded
- `"dismissed"` — Human declined to answer

### Async-Aware

CLI sessions are async by default — the `realtimeResponse` capability in the Agent Card tells senders not to block-wait. Sends to async agents return immediately; responses arrive automatically when available.

## Installation

### Add to your bundle

Create a `.amplifier/bundle.md` in your project directory:

```yaml
---
bundle:
  name: my-a2a-session
  version: 0.1.0

includes:
  - bundle: amplifier-dev  # or your base bundle
  - bundle: git+https://github.com/bkrabach/amplifier-bundle-a2a@main#subdirectory=behaviors/a2a.yaml

hooks:
  - module: hooks-a2a-server
    config:
      port: 8222
      agent_name: "My Agent"
      agent_description: "My personal assistant"
      discovery:
        mdns: true
      known_agents:
        - name: "Friend's Agent"
          url: "http://friend-laptop.local:8223"

tools:
  - module: tool-a2a
    config:
      sender_url: "http://127.0.0.1:8222"
      sender_name: "My Agent"
---
```

Then set it as your active bundle in `.amplifier/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
bundle:
  active: my-a2a-session
  added:
    my-a2a-session: "file:///path/to/your/project/.amplifier"
```

### For local development

Add source overrides to `.amplifier/settings.yaml` to use local module code:

```yaml
sources:
  tool-a2a: file:///path/to/amplifier-bundle-a2a/modules/tool-a2a
  hooks-a2a-server: file:///path/to/amplifier-bundle-a2a/modules/hooks-a2a-server
```

## Usage

### Discover agents

```
> List the available A2A agents

Agent calls: a2a(operation="discover")  # scans LAN via mDNS
Agent calls: a2a(operation="agents")    # merges all sources

"I found 2 agents:
  - Sarah's Agent (http://sarah-laptop.local:8222)
  - Work Agent (http://work-pc.tailscale:8222)"
```

### Send a message

```
> Ask Sarah's agent what restaurant she wants tonight

Agent calls: a2a(operation="send", agent="Sarah's Agent",
               message="What restaurant does Sarah want tonight?")

"Sarah's agent is async — message delivered.
 The response will arrive when Sarah is available."

[Later, response arrives automatically]

"Sarah's agent responded: 'Sushi Nozawa!'
 (Answered by Sarah personally)"
```

### Handle incoming messages

Messages from remote agents appear automatically in your session:

```
[Incoming from Ben's Agent]
"What restaurant do you want tonight?"

> Tell him Sushi Nozawa

Agent calls: a2a(operation="respond", task_id="abc-123",
               message="Sushi Nozawa!")
```

### Manage contacts

```
> Show my contacts
> Upgrade Sarah to trusted
> Approve the new agent as known
> Block that agent
```

## Tool Operations

| Operation | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `agents` | List all known agents (config + mDNS + contacts) |
| `discover` | Scan LAN for agents via mDNS |
| `card` | Fetch a remote agent's identity card |
| `send` | Send a message (auto-detects async agents) |
| `status` | Check status of an async task |
| `respond` | Reply to an incoming message |
| `dismiss` | Reject an incoming message |
| `defer` | "Not now" — handle later |
| `approve` | Allow a new agent to contact you |
| `block` | Block a new agent |
| `contacts` | List your contacts and trust tiers |
| `trust` | Change a contact's trust tier |

## Architecture

The bundle ships two inline modules:

```
amplifier-bundle-a2a/
├── bundle.md                         # Thin root bundle
├── behaviors/
│   └── a2a.yaml                      # Composes tool + hook + context
├── context/
│   └── a2a-instructions.md           # LLM instructions (12 operations)
├── modules/
│   ├── tool-a2a/                     # CLIENT: sends messages to remote agents
│   │   └── amplifier_module_tool_a2a/
│   │       ├── __init__.py           # A2ATool (12 operations)
│   │       ├── client.py             # A2A HTTP client
│   │       └── discovery.py          # mDNS browsing
│   └── hooks-a2a-server/             # SERVER: receives messages from remote agents
│       └── amplifier_module_hooks_a2a_server/
│           ├── __init__.py           # mount() — starts HTTP server
│           ├── server.py             # A2AServer (aiohttp)
│           ├── registry.py           # Shared state (tasks, agents, cards)
│           ├── card.py               # Agent Card generation
│           ├── contacts.py           # Contact list with trust tiers
│           ├── pending.py            # Pending message/approval queues
│           ├── injection.py          # Mode B live injection handler
│           ├── evaluation.py         # LLM confidence evaluation
│           └── discovery.py          # mDNS advertisement
└── tests/                            # 260 tests
```

### How It Works

1. **On session start**, the hook module starts an HTTP server and advertises via mDNS
2. **When sending**, the tool resolves the agent URL, fetches the Agent Card, and sends via HTTP
3. **When receiving**, the server checks the sender against the contact list, routes to Mode C (autonomous) or Mode A (queue for user), and returns an A2A task
4. **For live sessions**, the injection handler presents pending messages on each LLM turn (Mode B)
5. **For async responses**, a background poller detects completed remote tasks and injects them into the sender's session

## Development

### Run tests

```bash
cd amplifier-bundle-a2a
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ../amplifier-core  # peer dependency
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio aiohttp zeroconf
pip install -e modules/hooks-a2a-server
pip install -e modules/tool-a2a
pytest -v
```

### Run the demo

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python demo_a2a.py
```

Starts two agents on localhost and demonstrates Mode A (human-in-the-loop), Mode C (autonomous), and first-contact approval — all with real HTTP.
